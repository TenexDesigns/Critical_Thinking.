Of course! Let's go through the answers and reasoning for each of the questions:

1. If a plane crashes exactly on the border between two countries, where would the survivors be buried? Explain your reasoning.

Answer: The survivors would not be buried anywhere because they are still alive. The question assumes that there are survivors from the plane crash.

2. "All cats have fur." Is this statement a valid argument or a logical fallacy? Justify your answer.

Answer: The statement is a logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization or an overgeneralization. It is not true that all cats have fur, as some cat breeds, such as the Sphynx, are hairless.

3. You have a 3-gallon container and a 5-gallon container. How can you measure exactly 4 gallons of water using only these two containers and without any other measuring tools?

Answer: To measure exactly 4 gallons of water, you can follow these steps:
- Fill the 3-gallon container and pour it into the 5-gallon container.
- Fill the 3-gallon container again and carefully pour the water into the 5-gallon container until it is full (which leaves exactly 1 gallon of space in the 5-gallon container).
- Now, you have 1 gallon of water left in the 3-gallon container.
- Empty the 5-gallon container.
- Pour the 1 gallon of water from the 3-gallon container into the empty 5-gallon container.
- Finally, fill the 3-gallon container again and pour it into the 5-gallon container, which already has 1 gallon of water, making it a total of 4 gallons.

4. "I always lie." Is this statement a paradox? Explain why or why not.

Answer: Yes, the statement is a paradox known as the "liar's paradox." If the person is lying, then they are telling the truth, but if they are telling the truth, then they must be lying. It creates a logical contradiction.

5. A doctor gives you three pills to take, one pill every half hour. How long does it take to finish all three pills?

Answer: It takes one hour to finish all three pills. You take the first pill immediately, then the second pill after 30 minutes (half an hour), and the third pill after another 30 minutes, totaling one hour.

6. You have a digital clock that displays time in 24-hour format. How many times a day do all the digits on the clock form a valid mathematical equation?

Answer: The digits on the clock can form a valid mathematical equation 22 times a day. For example, at 12:34, the equation 12 + 3 = 4 is valid.

7. In a town, the barber shaves all those who do not shave themselves, and only those who do not shave themselves. Who shaves the barber?

Answer: This is a classic paradox known as the "Barber Paradox." The answer is that the barber cannot exist. If the barber shaves himself, then he is not supposed to shave himself according to the rules. If he does not shave himself, then he should shave himself according to the rules.

8. "If it's raining, then the ground is wet." Is this a valid or invalid argument? Justify your answer.

Answer: The argument is valid. If it's raining, it implies that water is falling from the sky, and it is reasonable to assume that the ground would be wet due to the rain.

9. A farmer has 15 sheep, and all but 9 die. How many sheep are left?

Answer: The statement says that "all but 9" sheep die. So, 15 - 9 = 6 sheep are left.

10. Three friends check into a hotel and decide to share the cost equally. The room costs $30, so each pays $10. Later, the hotel manager realizes there was a promotion, and the room only costs $25. The manager sends the bellboy with $5 as a refund. On the way, the bellboy wonders how to split the $5 among three people and decides to give each person $1 and keep $2 as a tip. Now, each person effectively paid $9 (totaling $27) and the bellboy kept $2, which adds up to $29. What happened to the missing dollar?

Answer: There is no missing dollar. The mistake in the reasoning is that the bellboy's tip of $2 should be subtracted from the total refund of $5, not added to it. The actual cost of the room was $25, and the bellboy returned $3 to the friends ($1 each). So, the total amount paid is $27 ($25 for the room and $2 tip to the bellboy), which matches the total cost of the room.

These questions aim to challenge your critical thinking and logical deduction skills, and it's normal to encounter tricky scenarios and paradoxes. Keep practicing and refining your reasoning abilities, as they are essential in various problem-solving situations.
