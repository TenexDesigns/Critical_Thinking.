Certainly! Let's go through the answers and reasoning for the questions:

1. How would you weigh a plane without using scales?
Answer: One possible answer is to use a see-saw or a balance with known weights on one side and the plane on the other side. By adjusting the known weights until the see-saw or balance is level, you can infer the weight of the plane based on the weights used.

2. Is it better to be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond? Justify your answer.
Answer: This question is subjective and depends on individual goals and preferences. Being a big fish in a small pond means you have a higher status and recognition in a smaller community, but there may be limited opportunities for growth and challenges. On the other hand, being a small fish in a big pond means you have more opportunities for growth, learning, and challenges, but you might not have the same level of recognition. The "better" option varies based on what one values more - recognition or growth opportunities.

3. You are in a pitch-black room with no windows or doors, and all you have is a matchstick and a candle. How do you light the candle?
Answer: You can light the matchstick and use the light from the matchstick to locate and light the candle.

4. If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Justify your answer.
Answer: This question can be interpreted philosophically. From a scientific standpoint, sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium to travel through, such as air. So, the falling tree would create vibrations in the air, which can be considered as sound, even if there is no one around to hear it. However, philosophically, the question challenges the notion of perception and observation, suggesting that without an observer, the event might not be "experienced" as sound.

5. A man gave one son 10 cents and another son was given 15 cents. What time is it?
Answer: This question is a play on words. The answer is "What time is it" because it is stated in the question itself. The amount of money given to the sons is just a distraction from the actual question.

6. You are standing in a room with three light switches outside the room. Each switch corresponds to a different light bulb inside the room. You can only enter the room once. How do you determine which switch controls which bulb?
Answer: Turn on one switch and wait for a few minutes. Turn off that switch and turn on another switch. Enter the room. The bulb that is on corresponds to the second switch. The bulb that is off and warm corresponds to the first switch. The bulb that is off and cool corresponds to the third switch.

7. "This statement is false." Is this statement a paradox or a logical fallacy? Explain your reasoning.
Answer: This statement is a paradox known as the liar paradox. If the statement is true, then it must be false. If it is false, then it must be true. This creates a contradiction, making it a paradox.

8. If a doctor gives you three pills and tells you to take one pill every hour, how long would it take to finish all the pills?
Answer: It would take three hours to finish all the pills. You take the first pill immediately, then one pill every hour, so it takes one hour for the second pill and another hour for the third pill, totaling three hours.

9. Is it possible for a person to be their own grandmother? Justify your answer.
Answer: This question is a play on words and is not possible in reality. It involves complicated family relationships that defy logic and biological constraints.

10. You have a jar filled with red and blue marbles. Without looking, how do you pick a single marble from the jar that ensures you know the proportion of red and blue marbles in the jar?
Answer: Take out a random marble from the jar and note its color. Without looking at the marble, put it back into the jar. Then, take out another marble. The proportion of red and blue marbles in the jar will be the same as the proportion of the first two marbles you picked.

Remember, these questions are meant to stimulate critical thinking, and there can be various interpretations and answers. The most important aspect is to engage in the thought process and reasoning behind each answer. Well done on attempting these questions!
